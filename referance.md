## Development Fund Proposal

**Author:** Mehmet Kar
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Project Name:** Nexus Framework (NXFS)

---

## Abstract
This proposal introduces the **Nexus Framework**, a developer experience (DX) powerhouse designed to bridge the chasm between the Canton Ledger and modern web ecosystems (Next.js, React, TanStack). Nexus is a type-safe **ORPC (Object Remote Procedure Call)** layer that transforms Daml Smart Contracts into a seamless, high-performance frontend developer experience.

By automating **Isomorphic Authentication**, **Consensus-Aware State Syncing**, and **Strict Type-Safe API Generation**, Nexus Framework eliminates the repetitive boilerplate and architectural friction that currently hinders the rapid adoption of the Canton Network by mainstream web engineering teams.

---

## Specification

### 1. Objective
The current Canton frontend ecosystem is fragmented, leading to what developers call a significant "Integration Tax." Community research across Daml Discourse, StackOverflow, and GitHub identifies four critical bottlenecks:

1. **Auth & Wallet Chaos:** Developers frequently report that mapping Browser Wallets to Canton Party IDs and managing short-lived JWTs is a "black box" that requires weeks of custom infrastructure work. [[1]](https://forum.canton.network/t/required-jwt-authorization-for-filters_by_party-of-active-contracts/8371) [[2]](https://forum.canton.network/t/jwt-auth-questions/2525)
2. **Modern React Incompatibility:** The legacy `@daml/react` suite has documented stability issues including a confirmed WebSocket reconnection bug in `useStreamQueries` (described by maintainers as "an experimental feature enabled by default with flaky behavior"), and does not support React 18/19 Concurrent Mode or Streaming/Suspense. [[3]](https://forum.canton.network/t/react-hook-websockets-failing-on-unmount-preventing-future-reconnects/4186)
3. **The Next.js SSR Gap:** Current tools are client-side only, leaving no clear path for developers to leverage **Next.js Server Components** or **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with the Canton ledger.
4. **API Fragmentation:** Engineers are forced to navigate gRPC, JSON API, and dApp API simultaneously. The Canton developer survey notes that "Package ID discovery for JSON API is opaque, forcing teams to build custom discovery mechanisms and caching layers for basic contract interactions." [[4]](https://forum.canton.network/t/canton-network-developer-experience-and-tooling-survey-analysis-2026/8412)

The goal of Nexus Framework is to consolidate these fragmented patterns into a single, high-performance "Standard Library." Nexus moves beyond simple hooks, providing a modular architecture that makes building on Canton as developer-friendly as building a standard Web2 app with tools like Stripe or Twilio, while ensuring **100% compatibility with modern React 19+ and Next.js 15+ standards**.

### 2. Evidence of Ecosystem Demand

The Canton Network Developer Experience & Tooling Survey (2026) — conducted with **41 active builders** between January and February 2026 — provides direct, data-driven validation for every problem Nexus addresses:

- **"Typed SDKs & language bindings"** ranked among the most requested missing tools, confirming the demand for a type-safe client layer.
- **"Standardized wallet adapter / MetaMask equivalent"** was identified as a top missing primitive, directly validating Nexus's Isomorphic Auth module.
- **"JWT authentication middleware implementation challenges"** was listed as a specific, recurring gap that every team currently solves independently.
- **71% of Canton developers come from an Ethereum background**, where tools like wagmi, viem, and ethers.js set the standard for type-safe, framework-native SDK DX. These developers expect the same level of tooling maturity from Canton.
- **80% of active builders joined within the last 12 months**, indicating a rapidly expanding ecosystem where a modern SDK will have immediate, broad impact.

> *"Developers are currently forced to be 'Infrastructure Engineers' before they can be 'Product Builders'."*
> — Canton Network Developer Experience Survey, 2026 [[4]](https://forum.canton.network/t/canton-network-developer-experience-and-tooling-survey-analysis-2026/8412)

Nexus directly addresses the top-ranked friction points in this survey. It is not a speculative tool; it resolves documented, recurring pain points reported by the active builder community.

**Additional technical evidence from community forums:**

- **React version lock-in:** The official `create-daml-app` scaffold pins projects to **React 16.12.0** — three major versions behind the current React 19. Developers attempting to upgrade immediately encounter irreconcilable peer dependency conflicts with `@daml/react`. [[5]](https://forum.canton.network/t/cannot-find-module-react-or-its-corresponding-type-declarations/2930)
- **Security vulnerabilities in official tooling:** Running `npm install` on the current `create-daml-app` template surfaces **75 vulnerabilities (42 high, 4 critical)** that cannot be resolved with `npm audit fix --force`. Developers are required to **downgrade npm from v9 to v8.6.0** to get the official template running at all. [[6]](https://forum.canton.network/t/error-while-loading-create-damp-app-on-firefox-npm-vulnerabilities-not-fixing-with-audit-force-fix/5945)
- **WebSocket memory leak in `@daml/react`:** The `useStreamQueries` hook does not clean up WebSocket connections on component unmount. Connections accumulate silently until the application crashes — one developer reported failure at **500 open connections**. The library exposes no API to close streams, forcing teams to use server-side timeouts as a workaround. [[7]](https://forum.canton.network/t/can-i-explicitly-release-websocket-connections-used-in-the-daml-react-bindings/5297)
- **Party ID resolution complexity:** Obtaining a stable Party ID for JWT generation requires a multi-step process: creating a party through the participant node → mapping to a stable username → generating an access token. There is no automated resolution layer; every team builds this flow independently. [[8]](https://forum.canton.network/t/party-ids-in-canton/4664)

These are not edge cases — they are the baseline experience for any team attempting to build a modern frontend on Canton today.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

The Nexus Framework architecture is comprised of three core modules designed to work independently or as a unified stack:

#### A. The Type-Safe ORPC Engine
Nexus consumes standard OpenAPI schemas and produces a strictly-typed TypeScript client.
- **Query Options Factory:** Automatically generates `queryOptions` and `queryKey` objects for TanStack Query, enabling deep integration with React query-caching.
- **Semantic Cache Management:** Uses Daml template structures to automatically invalidate related caches upon transaction success.

#### B. Isomorphic Auth & Identity
A headless authentication module that manages Canton-native identity flows.
- **Party ID Resolution:** Maps authenticated user sessions to Canton Party IDs via the Ledger Identity API, enabling seamless multi-party dApp interactions.
- **Secure Session Management:** Handles server-side JWT generation and secure `HttpOnly` cookie-based sessions, enabling SSR compatibility in Next.js.

#### C. Consensus-Aware Sync (Waiters)
Standalone, pluggable modules to observe transaction finality on the ledger.
- **Finality Observers:** Middleware-level observers that wait for ledger consensus before resolving mutation hooks, ensuring a consistent UI state without race conditions.

#### Technical Workflow

```

### 3. Architectural Alignment & Differentiation

This project directly addresses the **Developer Tooling** priority defined in CIP-0082/CIP-0100. It is a pure "Public Good" that does not alter Daml or Canton consensus rules but dramatically improves the frontend integration experience.

Nexus is architecturally positioned as the **frontend consumption layer** for the Canton ecosystem. It sits on top of any standard OpenAPI schema generated from Daml contracts and delivers type-safe React/Next.js integration without requiring changes to the underlying ledger infrastructure.

**Positioning relative to existing tools:**

| Tool | Scope | Nexus Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `@daml/react` | Client-side React hooks, no SSR, known WebSocket instability | Nexus replaces this layer with React 19+/SSR-compatible hooks |
| Canton JSON Ledger API | HTTP transport layer | Nexus consumes this — no overlap |
| Canton gRPC Ledger API | Low-level transport layer | Nexus abstracts over OpenAPI spec — no overlap |
| Wallet SDKs | Wallet connection & signing | Nexus's Auth module sits above wallet SDKs, consuming their output |
| TanStack Query | Client-side state management | Nexus generates native TanStack `queryOptions` — complements, not competes |

Nexus does not duplicate or replace any existing infrastructure. It is the missing layer between raw Canton APIs and modern frontend applications. No existing tool addresses SSR compatibility, type-safe codegen from OpenAPI, or consensus-aware state management for React applications.

**On coordination:** Because Nexus is purely additive and sits above existing transport layers, no direct coordination with current SDK maintainers is required to avoid overlap. Nexus consumes the Canton JSON Ledger API as a stable interface — it does not fork, patch, or compete with it. Should Digital Asset or the community ship an updated `@daml/react` in the future, Nexus can coexist alongside it or adapt its internals transparently, as the public API surface of Nexus is framework-level and independent of the underlying transport implementation. We will publish Nexus as open source from day one, inviting review and contribution from any existing Canton tooling maintainers who wish to collaborate.

### 4. Backward Compatibility
*No backward compatibility impact.*
Nexus is a purely additive frontend SDK. It consumes the existing Canton JSON Ledger API and does not modify any Canton or Daml runtime behavior. Projects using the legacy `@daml/react` hooks can migrate incrementally — Nexus can coexist alongside existing tools during a transition period.

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Milestone 1: Core Framework & Isomorphic Auth *(Minimal Viable Deliverable)*
- **Estimated Delivery:** 4 Weeks
- **Focus:** This milestone defines the minimal, self-contained core of Nexus. All subsequent milestones build on top of it. The committee can evaluate functional completeness at this stage independently.
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - Core `@nexus-framework/core` package published to npm.
  - Canton-native authentication flow with Party ID resolution and JWT session management.
  - Secure `HttpOnly` cookie-based sessions for Next.js SSR compatibility.
  - Basic ledger connectivity (query active contracts, submit commands).
  - Unit and integration test suite with 80%+ coverage.
  - Documentation with quickstart guide and API reference.

> **Milestone 1 stands alone as the reusable infrastructure foundation.** The ORPC codegen engine, TanStack adapter, and CLI tooling are additive layers built in Milestones 2–3. If scope were ever reduced, Milestone 1 output remains independently useful to the ecosystem.

### Milestone 2: TanStack Adapter & Async Sync Engine
- **Estimated Delivery:** 3 Weeks
- **Focus:** Type-safe data layer and React/Next.js integration.
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - `@nexus-framework/react` package with TanStack Query integration.
  - Codegen engine consuming OpenAPI schemas to produce typed `queryOptions` and `queryKey` factories.
  - Next.js Server Actions integration layer for server-side ledger operations.
  - Automated Daml-template-aware cache invalidation logic.
  - Integration tests against real Daml contracts on Canton Sandbox.

### Milestone 3: Consensus Observers & CLI Tooling
- **Estimated Delivery:** 3 Weeks
- **Focus:** Transaction finality tracking and developer onboarding tools.
- **Deliverables / Value Metrics:**
  - WebSocket-based Finality Waiters that resolve mutation hooks only after ledger consensus.
  - HTTP-polling fallback for environments without WebSocket support.
  - `create-nexus-app` CLI for instant project scaffolding with pre-configured Canton connectivity.
  - Headless UI Status components (transaction pending, confirmed, failed states).
  - End-to-end example dApp demonstrating the complete OpenAPI → Nexus → Production workflow.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
The Tech & Ops Committee will evaluate completion based on:

- Deliverables completed as specified for each milestone.
- **Type Safety:** 100% end-to-end TypeScript safety from Daml Choice to React Hook, verified by compilation with `strict: true`.
- **Auth Speed:** Successful user-to-session conversion in < 2 seconds.
- **Consensus Accuracy:** Transaction mutation resolving only AFTER ledger finality event is captured, demonstrated in integration tests.
- **Next.js 15+ Compatibility:** Successful data fetching within a Server Component using a secure session cookie.
- **Open Source:** All packages released under Apache 2.0 license with comprehensive documentation.
- Documentation and knowledge transfer provided.

### Adoption Success Metrics

Success will be measured by organic ecosystem adoption after release, tracked over 90 days post-launch:

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| npm weekly downloads | 500+ / week |
| GitHub stars | 200+ |
| Community-reported integrations | 2+ projects referencing Nexus on Canton/Daml forums |
| GitHub issues filed by external contributors | 5+ (indicates real-world usage) |

These metrics are independent of any single organization and reflect genuine ecosystem adoption. They will be reported to the committee in a post-release update.

- A video walkthrough building a complete dApp from scratch using the Nexus CLI.
- Promotion through the Daml Forum, npm registry, and frontend developer communities.

---

## Motivation
A blockchain network's growth is ultimately bottlenecked by the speed at which frontend teams can build user-facing applications. Currently, non-Daml engineers face significant friction when building UIs for Canton:

1. **No modern React support:** The legacy `@daml/react` library does not support React 18+ Concurrent Mode, Suspense boundaries, or Server Components.
2. **No SSR path:** Server-Side Rendering — a baseline requirement for modern web apps — has no established pattern for Canton.
3. **Manual boilerplate:** Every team independently builds auth flows, state management, and cache invalidation logic.
4. **No consensus-aware UI:** Standard frontend tools resolve on HTTP status codes, not on ledger finality, leading to inconsistent UI states.

By providing Nexus, we give Canton the same caliber of frontend DX that Web2 developers expect from platforms like Firebase, Supabase, or Convex — making Canton the first institutional blockchain with a truly modern frontend SDK.

---

## Rationale
**Why ORPC instead of REST/GraphQL wrappers?**
ORPC (Object Remote Procedure Call) provides end-to-end type safety without schema duplication. Unlike REST wrappers that lose type information at the HTTP boundary, ORPC preserves the full Daml type hierarchy from contract to UI component.

**Why TanStack Query integration?**
TanStack Query is the de facto standard for server state management in React applications (15M+ weekly npm downloads). Native integration eliminates the need for custom caching and state synchronization logic.

**Why consensus-aware waiters?**
Unlike standard databases where a successful write is immediately consistent, Canton transactions require ledger consensus. Nexus's Finality Waiters abstract this complexity, giving developers a familiar `useMutation` → `onSuccess` pattern that only resolves after true finality.

**Why the name "Nexus"?**
A nexus is a connection point linking different systems. Nexus Framework is the connection point between the Canton Ledger and the modern web — linking Daml's type system to React's component model.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Extending `@daml/react`:* Rejected — the existing library's architecture is incompatible with React 18+ Concurrent Mode and would require a full rewrite.
- *GraphQL layer:* Rejected — adds unnecessary complexity and an additional schema translation step.
- *Generic ORPC tools (tRPC, oRPC):* Rejected — they are "Ledger Blind" and cannot handle consensus-aware state management or Canton-native authentication.

---

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk: Canton SDK/API changes in future versions.**
  - *Mitigation:* Version-agnostic adapter layer that isolates Nexus from underlying API changes. Automated CI tests against multiple SDK versions.
- **Risk: JWT token expiration during long user sessions.**
  - *Mitigation:* Automatic silent-refresh middleware that renews tokens before expiry without disrupting user experience.
- **Risk: WebSocket instability in corporate/firewall environments.**
  - *Mitigation:* Secondary HTTP long-polling fallback mechanism that activates automatically when WebSocket connections fail.
- **Risk: OpenAPI schema variations across different generators.**
  - *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to OpenAPI v3.1 specification. Validation test suite covering common schema patterns generated from Daml contracts.

## Team and Capabilities
The author is a developer dedicated to contributing to the Canton Network ecosystem. Working within a small, dynamic team, we combine academic perspectives with hands-on experience in modern frontend frameworks (React, Next.js), TypeScript tooling, and Daml smart contracts. Our mission is to make Canton the most developer-friendly institutional blockchain by delivering production-quality open-source tools.

Nexus is not being built in isolation. An active Canton-based project — currently in development and not yet publicly announced — has committed to adopting Nexus as its primary frontend integration layer. This gives us a real production use case driving design decisions from day one, and ensures that Milestone 1 will be validated against an actual application before the final release. We are actively reaching out to additional teams in the Canton builder community to expand early adopter coverage ahead of the public launch.
